## Case Study: Analyze data to evaluate cereal information to predict consumer rating
This course has occurred at a time of global high stress, so this project is to be something lighthearted. I reviewed many medical, political, and sports focused datasets that all just seemed to serious. Luckily, I stumbled on the topic of cereal, an interesting and somewhat silly topic. The data for this case study is a list of numerous brands of cereal by multiple manufactures. While not all encompassing, the data is comprehensive enough to predict how a cereal might score with a consumer based on several variables/features.
